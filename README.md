# Problem-Series

This repository is dedicated to collecting "Problem Series" with regard to existing and developing software. Some of these problems may be hard to describe, so this repository is planned to be just a series of folders (one per "problem") with names of "Problem_xxx". Each problem can be described in this README.md file. If the list gets too long, it can be subdivided.

## Problem_001

This is a relatively simple series with 5 objects and 3 sections created by Reconstruct.jar. It can be opened by Reconstruct.exe, and it will display the first section. The mouse scroll wheel can then move to the second section, but then it will freeze. Attempts to scroll forward or backward will not change the screen. Scrolling the wheel backward generates no activity at all, but scrolling forward will briefly display the "waiting" cursor icon. The "List Sections" option will only show one section (even though there are 3).

This problem likely results from mal-formed XML, but there are no error messages (even when Reconstruct is run from the command line).
